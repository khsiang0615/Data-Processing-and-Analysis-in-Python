The team took a dataset of the Chicago bike sharing system, Divvy, to understand how different time periods and weather influence the demand for rides and trip duration for various user types and ensure adequate bikes are available across the city so that everyone has the option of reducing their carbon footprint by using Divvy.

The project can be broken down into following steps:
1. Define Questions of Interest
2. Data Processing
  - Filtering
  - Handling missing values
  - Datetime extraction and transformation
  - Data binning
  - Feature engineering/creating variables
3. Data Analysis
  - Calculation
  - Visualization
  - Trend identification
  - Conclusion (business recommendations)
  
Libraries Used
  - Numpy
  - Pandas
  - Datetime
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Plotly Mapbox
